# VG-STC-Driver
This repo is to house the source vode for a custom Windows Universal User Mode Driver to support the Samsung VG-STC5000 camera on Windows OS.

## The Need
The VG-STC5000 video camera is a high quality device design for use with a Smart TV, but it is no longer supported. I felt the need to write my own driver so I could use such a great camera on Windows devices and not simply be constrained to using the Smart TV.

## To Do
1. This device works on Samsung TV which runs on Tizen OS and this OS is based on Linux, now keeping that in mind I am looking into the source of Tizen OS to find the driver for this device and possibly port it over to Linux and Windows.
